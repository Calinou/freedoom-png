This directory contains patch textures. These are composited together to
make up the in-game wall textures. More information can be found in the
Doom wiki:

    <http://doomwiki.org/wiki/Patch>

Placing a GIF file in this directory will not cause it to be included in
the built IWADs; the name of the new patch must be used in at least one
texture in the configuration file `lumps/textures/textures.cfg'. Patches
are automatically included in the IWADs based on the texture lump
configuration.
