This directory contains the sprites used to represent the in-game
monsters and other objects encountered within the game ("things"). There
are a lot of of sprites because a lot of objects, particularly monsters,
can be viewed from up to 8 different angles. The filenames follow very
a specific naming convention. For more information, see the Doom wiki:
