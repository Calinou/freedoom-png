Freedoom is a collaborative effort to
create a complete free content game.
It is the combined work of many, many
different artists, musicians, level
designers and programmers, more than is
possible to list on this page alone.
Thanks go to everyone who has contributed
and helped to make Freedoom a reality.

Freedoom is distributed as free software
under the terms of the BSD license, and is
under continual development and
improvement. If you like the project and
